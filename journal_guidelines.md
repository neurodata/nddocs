## [science](http://www.sciencemag.org/authors/science-information-authors):

- report: 2500 words including captions & refs, 4 figs, 30 refs
- article: 4500 words including caps & refs, 6 figs, 40 refs, 

assuming 15 words per line, that is:

- report: 167 lines
- article: 300 lines

subtracting 1 line  per reference:

- report: 137 lines
- article: 260 lines

assuming a 20/60 relative faction meaning intro and discussion each get 20%, results get 60%, yields 

- report: 27/82
- article: 52/156

50% over yields:

- report: 40/123; total = 203
- article: 78/234; total = 390
