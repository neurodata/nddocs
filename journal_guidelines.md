## [science](http://www.sciencemag.org/authors/science-information-authors):

- report: 2500 words including captions & refs, 4 figs, 30 refs
- article: 4500 words including caps & refs, 6 figs, 40 refs, 

submit as article, they will typically require downsampling to report.

intro: 900
results: 2700
disc: 900

20% over the limit yields 5400 words:

intro: 1080
results: 3240
disc: 900

in line numbers, 360 lines total, but subtract 40 lines for references, leaves 320

intro: 64 lines
results: 192 lines
disc: 64 lines
