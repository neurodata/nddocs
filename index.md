- [*tutorials*](http://docs.neurodata.io/nddocs/tutorials.html) We provide software to lower the barrier to entry as much as we can to performing reproducible and extensible big data neuroscience.  To assist, we provide a number of tutorials, largely based on user feedback.  If you have other questions that we have not yet answered, please [ask them](mailto:support@neurodata.io). 

- [*computer science*](http://docs.neurodata.io/nddocs/cs.html) The raw data of the 21st century is often so large as to break the typical data analytic workflow.  We therefore have built tools that can scale to support answering the scientific questions of our time, using as much or as little data as sufficient.

- *big data sharing* Each of the questions relies on careful analysis of the data, including raw images, derived annotations, and graphs.  We provide those data in formats that ease access and analysis.  Please [inquire](mailto:support@neurodata.io) if you'd like some of these data in a different format.

- [*statistical science*](http://docs.neurodata.io/nddocs/stats.html) Statistical sciences have developed a beautiful corpus of knowledge on inference in various settings over the last 100 years. However, in recent years, new experimental and data collection methods have yielded datasets that no longer fit within the assumptions upon which that body of literature rests. We therefore focus on building statistical methods for 21st century data.

- [*neuroscience*](http://docs.neurodata.io/nddocs/neuro.html) The above described tools, both statistical and computational, are designed and built in the service of answering fundamental questions in neuroscience. We have used them on the data we share to answer a number of previously intractable questions.
