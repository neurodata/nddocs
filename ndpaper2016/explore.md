## Images

We have curated a collection of image datasets and setup pre-configured *NeuroDataViz* projects for them. This data is available by visiting http://viz.neurodata.io and clicking on "Data".

The data in Figure 2(a) was collected by Bobby Kasthuri in 2011 and published in 2015. The global dataset is available at http://viz.neurodata.io/project/kasthuri11cc. The data used to generate the figure was taken from the following subregion: http://viz.neurodata.io/project/kasthuri11cc/xy/2/2439/4281/1100/. In *NDStore* parlance, the data is identified as follows:

| Key | Value |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Token | kasthuri11cc |
| Channel | image |
| Resolution | 2 |
| x-coordinate | 2439 |
| y-coordinate | 4281 |
| z-coordinate | 1100 |

This data can be downloaded using raw *NDStore* APIs, *CAJAL*, or *ndio*.

In addition to the data exhibited in Figure 2, we wish to highlight the following published 8-bit EM Datasets:

|Dataset | URL |
|--------|-----|
| Mouse S1 (Kasthuri et al., 2015) | http://viz.neurodata.io/dataview/mouseS1 |
| Mouse V1 (Bock et al., 2011) | http://viz.neurodata.io/dataview/bock11 |
| Rat Hippocampal CA1 neuropil (Harris et al., 2015) | http://viz.neurodata.io/dataview/kharris15 |
| Cardona et al. | http://viz.neurodata.io/dataview/acardona |
| C. elegans hermaphrodite pharynx (Bhatla et al., 2015) | http://viz.neurodata.io/dataview/bhatla15 |
| Fly Medulla	(Takemura et al., 2013) | http://viz.neurodata.io/dataview/takemura13 |

## Annotations

Several of the above mentioned image datasets include paint. However, only a small number of paint datasets include RAMON metadata. The data used in Figure2(c) is a paint dataset that includes RAMON metadata, and is available at http://viz.neurodata.io/project/kasthuri2015_ramon_v4. The EM layer (**kasthuri11cc**, from *Images*) is used as a base.

The specific data used in Figure 2(c) is available at http://viz.neurodata.io/project/kasthuri2015_ramon_v4/xy/2/2439/4281/1100/. To bring up object metadata shown in the figure, first mouse over the query tool (the magnifying glass) and select *Synapses* in the dropdown query box. Next, click on the relevant synapse (synapse #37, located between the pink and brown neurons, to the right of the large purple neuron). If you are having trouble identifying the Synapse, the following URL will place a marker at the synapse location (though the overall screen center will be slightly different than the center used in the figure):: http://viz.neurodata.io/project/kasthuri2015_ramon_v4/xy/2/2433/4295/1100/marker/.

The following projects from the Images table also include annotation data:
