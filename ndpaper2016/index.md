# Abstract
Recent technical progress allows neuroexperimentalists to collect ever
more detailed and informative anatomical and physiological data from
brains of all sizes.  These datasets span experimentally accessible
spatiotemporal scales, ranging from nanometer to meter, and millisecond
to monthly sampling rates.  In classical neuroscientific experimental
paradigms, it was feasible for neuroscientists to draw their results on
paper. In contrast, many modern neuroscientific experimental paradigms
break the classic data analysis workflow.  In particular, these large
datasets create significant challenges for our community at every step
of the data analysis pipeline: (1) storing, (2) exploring, (3) parsing,
and (4)  analyzing. <i> NeuroData</i> has been developed to lower the
barrier to entry into big data neuroscience. We have designed and built
a comprehensive ecosystem towards enabling petascale neuroscience.  This
includes our flagship project,  the <i>NeuroData Connectome Project</i> 
(previously called the Open Connectome Project). Our
infrastructure enables anyone in the world with internet access to
visualize, download, analyze, upload, and interact with a large number
of public datasets.  Moreover, all the results obtained using the
NeuroData infrastructure are fundamentally reproducible and extensible.
We demonstrate the utility of these tools via two serial electron
microscopy case studies.  First, we have reproduced many of the
quantitative results from a recent landmark EM paper that included a
saturated annotation of a region of cortex. Second, we have tested a 
novel hypothesis about the distribution of synapse locations in cortex 
on a larger, complementary dataset. Via the <i>NeuroData</i> 
infrastructure, the answers given by these tools are both fully 
reproducible, and extensible for analysis on other datasets that hold 
knowledge about these questions. NeuroData democratizes the scientific 
process, enabling anyone, regardless of their background, computational 
resources, and expertise to study neuroscience at scale.  
We are in the process of scaling up the number of datasets, 
the range of experimental modalities, and the Web-services
we enable. Work underway will provide pre-packaged cluster
environments—--easily deployable on local or commercial cloud computing
infrastructures—--so that others can replicate and modify our services
internally. All of our code and data are available online at <a

accordance with open science standards.
