# ndmg

NeuroData's MR Graphs package, **ndmg** (pronounced "***nutmeg***"), is the successor of the MRCAP, MIGRAINE, and m2g pipelines. **ndmg** combines dMRI and sMRI data from a single subject to estimate a high-level connectome reliably and scalably.

Using **ndmg**, we are processing brain scans on an ongoing basis, and the resulting graphs are made available to the community through our graph database, [MR-grutedb](http://openconnecto.me/graph-services/).


### Getting Started

Here are a few guides so you can start playing with **ndmg**:

- [ndmg architecture](./architecture.html)
- [installing ndmg](./install.html)
- [preparing your data](./data.html)
- [generate your brain graphs](./use_ndmg.html)


### Code & Contributing
All of our code is open source and hosted at [github](https://github.com/neurodata/ndmg/). Feel free to issue a pull request for an awesome new feature or bug fix - we're always looking forward to new brain-mapping enthusiasts to work with!
